# Digital Porfolio

## User Story

Three weeks into the coding bootcamp and we are coding our first project from scratch. We have been assigned to work on a digital portfolio resume that will be constantly updated as we progress throughout the course.The following requirements were to be expected as such:
A systematic hmtl format that holds a paragraph about the student with their recent projects and contact information.
  * A linked stylesheet that is properly linked to the Html file.
  * A recent avatar photo of the student and navigation bar that once click, it flows to the corresponding section in the website. 
  * The projects were to be layed out in a grid format with a couple of hover responsed to make the web page a little more engaging to the consumer.
  * As the course progresses, the projects will added in the grid holder section that will directly send the reader to the local url of the project.
 
 
 ## Acceptance Criteria
 
I began with creating the html file annd linked the css sheet that is attached to the files of this document (assets folder). I added <div containers in the area's that I wanted to style wihtout there being any conflicts of styles overlapping. I creaded and navigation bar with the title and photo hovering around the top. I added a banner to give the layout a bit of speration. The body consists of a short paragraph about how I actually got into coding. Bellow it, you will see a grid layout of mock photo's. In the Follwing weeks those will be upated to links that will show actual projects being created by me. the lower layout is the footer that has my contact information. This section will also be updated. For the time, the linkedin section will hold as a placehold while I contact the career service department to get an idea of what should be inculded in that account once created.

## Assets 

The folder attached to the repo (assets) contains the images linked to the webpage and the style.css.
You can clone a copy to your local docs by putting the ssh link to your clipboard and using the comman GIT CLONE flowed by the ssh link in your terminal.
* Bellow you will find an image of the webpage.
